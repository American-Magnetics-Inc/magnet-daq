The Magnet-DAQ application *requires* firmware version 2.55 or later in the Model 430 programmer. Magnet-DAQ is also a required prerequisite for the [Multi-Axis Operation](https://bitbucket.org/americanmagneticsinc/multi-axis-operation) open source application developed by AMI for control of AMI Maxes(tm) magnet systems.### Firmware Upgrade ###An integrated Firmware Upgrade Wizard is included in the application along with the latest Model 430 firmware versions 2.59 (legacy) and 3.09. Upon connection to a Model 430, the application will present the Firmware Upgrade Wizard as appropriate, or on demand via the new toolbar icon.**NOTE:** The latest firmware includes optional communication on Ethernet port 7185 without the "welcome message." This is of importance to customers using VISA and LabVIEW to develop "stateless" communication drivers, and in fact the latest [AMI Drivers for LabVIEW](https://bitbucket.org/americanmagneticsinc/ami-drivers) require port 7185.## Manual Updates? ##Updated Model 430 and Power Supply System manuals are available to document all the new features in the latest Model 430 firmware:* [Generic Model 430 Manual including High-Stability Option and 3-Axis Systems (Rev 9)](https://bitbucket.org/americanmagneticsinc/magnet-daq/downloads/mn-430-rev9.pdf)* [AMI 4-Quadrant Power Supply Systems including High-Stability Option and 3-Axis Systems (Rev 9)](https://bitbucket.org/americanmagneticsinc/magnet-daq/downloads/mn-4QPS-rev9.pdf)* [AMI Bipolar (2-Quadrant) Power Supply Systems (Rev 9)](https://bitbucket.org/americanmagneticsinc/magnet-daq/downloads/mn-Bipolar-rev9.pdf)## How do I install? ##Pre-compiled, ready-to-use binaries are available in the Downloads section of this repository:* [Installer for 64-bit Microsoft Windows 7 or later](https://bitbucket.org/americanmagneticsinc/magnet-daq/downloads/MagnetDAQ-Setup.msi) - Simply download and run the installer.* [Installer for 32-bit Microsoft Windows 7 or later](https://bitbucket.org/americanmagneticsinc/magnet-daq/downloads/MagnetDAQ-Setup-Win32.msi)* [Executable for 64-bit Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 or later recommended)](https://bitbucket.org/americanmagneticsinc/magnet-daq/downloads/Magnet-DAQ.zip) - See the README file in the download for the instructions for deploying on Ubuntu.* [Application for 64-bit Apple macOS (Sierra or later recommended)](https://bitbucket.org/americanmagneticsinc/magnet-daq/downloads/Magnet-DAQ.app.zip) - Unzip the download and copy the Magnet-DAQ.app folder to your desired location.## How do I compile the source? ##* __Summary of set up__	* Clone or download the source code repository to your local drive.		* *For Windows*: Open the Magnet-DAQ.sln file in [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/free-developer-offers/). If using Visual Studio, you should also install the [Qt Visual Studio Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheQtCompany.QtVisualStudioTools-19123) extension to enable pointing your project to your currently installed Qt distribution for Visual Studio.		* *For Linux and Mac*: Open the Magnet-DAQ.pro file in QtCreator.* __Dependencies__	* Requires [Qt 5.13.1 or later open-source distribution](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/)	* The help file was written using [Help & Manual 7.3.5](https://www.helpandmanual.com/). Reproduction of the Help output included in the binaries requires a license for Help & Manual.* __Deployment hints for your own compilations__	* *For Windows*: The MagnetDAQ-Setup folder contains a setup project for producing a Windows installer. This requires the [Visual Studio Installer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects) extension. A bin folder is referenced by the installer where you should place the binaries for packaging by the installer.		* *For Linux:* See the README file in the binary download (see above) for the instructions for deploying on Ubuntu. Other versions of Linux may require a different procedure. High-DPI display support functions flawlessly in KDE Plasma (not surprising since KDE is Qt-based). The application exhibits various unaddressed issues with high-DPI display in other desktop managers such as Unity and Gnome, as does the general desktop environment for those desktop managers at present.		* *For Mac*: Simply unzip the binary distribution and copy the .app folder to the desired location. In order to include the Qt runtime libraries in any app bundle you compile yourself, you should use the [Mac Deployment Tool](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/osx-deployment.html#macdeploy).## License ##The Magnet-DAQ program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or any later version.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
